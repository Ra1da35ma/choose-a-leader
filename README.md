This is the Electronic Voting App for the Nigerian Bar Association.

To run the app:


1. Clone it from the Repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `bower install`
4. Run `grunt serve`

These instructions assume that you have a fairly good idea of what the project's meant to do.

You also need to have a local instance of MongoDB running.

Cheers
